      <h2>Emotionally Healthy Spirituality: It's Impossible to Be Spiritually Mature, While Remaining Emotionally Immature</h2>
      <div class="inline">
        <h5 class="author">by Peter Scazzero</h5>
        <span class="rating">4.23<!-- out of 5.0 --> Hoots </span><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22574099-emotionally-healthy-spirituality" target="_blank" title="View book in GoodReads" class="drop-target"><img src="/images/info.svg" class="info" alt="Info" /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="description">Peter Scazzero learned the hard way: you can't be spiritually mature while remaining emotionally immature. Even though he was a pastor of a growing church, he did what most people do:Avoid conflict in the name of ChristianityIgnore his anger, sadness, and fearUse God to run from GodLive without boundariesEventually God awakened him to a biblical integration of emotional health, a relationship with Jesus, and the classic practices of contemplative spirituality. It created nothing short of a spiritual revolution, utterly transforming him and his church.In this best-selling book Scazzero outlines his journey and the signs of emotionally unhealthy spirituality. Then he provides seven biblical, reality-tested ways to break through to the revolutionary life Christ meant for you. “The combination of emotional health and contemplative spirituality,” he says, “unleashes the Holy Spirit inside us so that we might experientially know the power of an authentic life in Christ.”</p>

      <h2>Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life</h2>
      <div class="inline">
        <h5 class="author">by Henry Cloud, John Townsend</h5>
        <span class="rating">4.19<!-- out of 5.0 --> Hoots </span><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944267.Boundaries" target="_blank" title="View book in GoodReads" class="drop-target"><img src="/images/info.svg" class="info" alt="Info" /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="description">Having clear boundaries is essential to a healthy, balanced lifestyle. A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.</p>

      <h2>The Emotionally Healthy Church, Updated and Expanded Edition: A Strategy for Discipleship That Actually Changes Lives</h2>

      </div>
      <p class="description">The Emotionally Healthy Church, Expanded Edition, the newly updated and expanded edition of the groundbreaking bestseller The Emotionally Healthy Church, features a fuller, deeper look at the six principles contained in the original and includes a crucial, additional chapter: Slow Down to Lead with Integrity.New Life Fellowship in Queens, New York, had it all: powerful teaching, dynamic ministries, an impressive growth rate, and a vision to do great works for God. Things looked good—but beneath the surface, circumstances were more than just brewing. They were about to boil over, forcing Peter Scazzero to confront needs in his church and himself that went deeper than he’d ever imagined. What he learned about the vital link between emotional health, relational depth, and spiritual maturity can shed new light on painful problems in your own church.In this revised and expanded edition of his Gold Medallion Award–winning book, Scazzero shares refreshing new insights and a different and challenging slant on what it takes to lead your congregation to wholeness and maturity in Christ. Our churches are in trouble, says Scazzero.They are filled with people who are:• unsure how to biblically integrate anger, sadness, and other emotions• defensive, incapable of revealing their weaknesses• threatened by or intolerant of different viewpoints• zealous about ministering at church but blind to their spouses’ loneliness at home• so involved in “serving” that they fail to take care of themselves• prone to withdraw from conflict rather than resolve itSharing from New Life Fellowship’s painful but liberating journey, Scazzero reveals exactly how the truth can and does make you free—not just superficially, but deep down. This expanded edition of The Emotionally Healthy Church not only takes the original six principles further and deeper, but also adds a seventh crucial principle. You’ll acquire knowledge and tools that can help you and others:• look beneath the surface of problems• break the power of past wounds, failures, sins, and circumstances• live a life of brokenness and vulnerability• recognize and honor personal limitations and boundaries• embrace grief and loss• make incarnation your model to love others• slow down to lead with integrityThis new edition shares powerful insights on how contemplative spirituality can help you and your church slow down—an integral key to spiritual and emotional health. The Emotionally Healthy Church, Expanded Edition includes story after story of people at New Life whose lives have been changed by the concepts in this book. Open these pages and find out how your church can turn a new corner on the road to spiritual maturity.</p>
